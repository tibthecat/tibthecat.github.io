# DeFi Security Tips from the Trenches

DeFi is exciting—I love building protocols, vaults, bridges, and synthetic tokens—but one thing I’ve learned the hard way: **security is everything**. Here are some practical tips from my experience building Numa and other projects.

## 1. Keep Contracts Simple and Safe
- Follow **Check-Effects-Interactions** to avoid nasty reentrancy bugs.  
- Rely on audited libraries like **OpenZeppelin**.  
- Make critical parameters **immutable** if possible—don’t leave unnecessary doors open.

## 2. Oracles Matter
- Use **decentralized oracles** like Chainlink; don’t trust a single endpoint.  
- TWAPs (Time-Weighted Average Prices) help smooth volatile token prices.  
- Add sanity checks—never assume the data is perfect.

## 3. Access Control Is Key
- Use **role-based permissions** for admin functions.  
- Multi-signature wallets are your friend for anything that moves money or mints tokens.  
- Lock down minting and transfers carefully; a tiny oversight can be costly.

## 4. Test Everything
- Unit tests and integration tests are mandatory. Cover every edge case.  
- Use **invariant testing** to assert important rules like total supply vs. vault balances.  
- Fuzz inputs to uncover unexpected behavior.  
- Public audits or contests are great ways to catch what you might miss.

## 5. Cross-Chain Considerations
- Whitelist bridge adapters to prevent unauthorized transfers.  
- Handle async calls carefully; cross-chain operations are tricky.  
- Test latency and failure cases—stuff breaks in the wild.

## 6. Minimize Attack Surface
- Keep contracts modular, but avoid unnecessary complexity.  
- Remove unused functions and state variables.  
- Add **emergency pause functions** so you can act if something goes wrong.
