**[Numa project](https://numa.money/)**  

Numa is a custom DeFi protocol focused on vault-based synthetic assets, lending, and cross-chain liquidity. The project integrates on-chain and off-chain components to provide secure, composable financial primitives.  

Key contributions and features:

- **Full-stack Solidity development:** Sole author of all production contracts, testing suites, and deployment scripts.  
- **Vault mechanics:** Users can mint and redeem synthetic tokens backed by underlying collateral with dynamic pricing.  
- **Lending system:** Forked and adapted Compound V2 for custom lending/borrowing logic with precise TVL-based reward distribution.  
- **Cross-chain bridging:** Integrated LayerZero OFT token bridging with secure whitelisting patterns to prevent unauthorized transfers.  
- **Price feeds & TWAPs:** Built synthetic pricing using Uniswap V3 TWAP oracles for reliable, tamper-resistant valuations.  
- **Deployment & verification:** Deployed all contracts on Arbitrum and ensured full on-chain verification and reproducibility.  
- **Auditing & security:** Participated in Sherlock public contest, reviewed code for vulnerabilities, and implemented security-hardening patterns.  
- **Developer tooling:** Created automated Foundry scripts for deployment, bridging setup, and continuous testing across multiple chains.  

Numa demonstrates end-to-end protocol design, cross-chain mechanics, and production-ready DeFi security practices.
